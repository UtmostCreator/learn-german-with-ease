1. Hallo – “Hello”
2. Guten Tag – “Good day”
3. Alles klar – “All clear” ~“what's up?”

4. Was ist los? – “What’s up?”
los roughly means “separate” or “free”. 
Asking someone was ist los? is like saying “what's up?”
“what's going on?”, ~= alles klar?
5. Wie geht es dir? (informal) – “How’s it going?”
wie geht es Ihnen? (formal)
When informally addressing a group, say Wie geht es euch?

6. Grüß Gott! – “God bless you”
Bavaria (south-eastern Germany) and Austria.
“greetings (from) God”.
 A better, less literal translation is “God bless you”. It's a very formal way of saying hello.

Bavarians also use Grüß dich!, which essentially means “greetings to you!”. (for old mens /womens)

7. Servus – “At your service” (from Latin)
 Bavaria and Austria. It can also be used to say goodbye

8. Moin! – “Hi!”
in northern Germany, especially in and around Hamburg. You also sometimes hear people doubling it up: moin moin!

9. Na – “Hi, how are you? Fine thanks, how are you?”
Na is another regional German greeting. It's common in the north, and people from Southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland tend to struggle with it. I can't blame them, because it's hard to explain.

10. Hier ist… Roman – “It’s…” Roman

11. Tschüss – “Goodbye”

12. Ciao – “Bye”
Ciao is Italian in origin, but it's common in Germany, as it is in many other parts of Europe!

13. Auf Wiedersehen – “See you again”
Wieder means “again” and sehen means “to see”. So auf wiedersehen essentially means “when we see each other again!”

14. Bis bald – “See you soon”
This literally means “until soon”. So it's like saying “see you soon!”. It's a friendly, informal way of saying goodbye.
